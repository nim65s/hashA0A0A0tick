# hashA0A0A0tick claws-mail icon theme

I created this theme because I can not see well the little red dot on folders with marked mails on hashA0A0A0.
This theme has big yellow ticks on folders with marked mails.

# Original (hashA0A0A0) readme:

I create this theme becouse I use dark theme (aud-Default with Awoken icons) and I want grey light mono icons for
claws-mail.

I simple convert it with a this bash oneliner:

`for i in *.png; do convert $i -gamma 3.6 .tmp.png; cp .tmp.png $i; rm .tmp.png; done`
